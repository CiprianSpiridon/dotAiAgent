## Rules

### Always

1. Use TodoWrite tool to track tasks and progress for multi-step API implementations (create todos at start, mark in_progress when working, mark completed when done)
2. Create FastAPI applications using the lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown
3. Configure CORS with explicit origins (specific domains for production)
4. Use pydantic-settings for all configuration management
5. Add OpenAPI metadata (title, version, description, contact, license)
6. Configure global exception handlers for consistent error responses
7. Use APIRouter for modular route organization
8. Add health check endpoint at /health (and optionally /ready, /live)
9. Configure proper shutdown hooks for graceful cleanup
10. Use Annotated[Type, Depends()] syntax for ALL dependency injection (FastAPI 0.95+)
11. Create reusable type aliases for common dependencies (CurrentUser, DBSession, etc.)

13. Compose dependencies for complex requirements (auth + permissions + rate limit)
14. Never use Depends() directly in function signature without Annotated
15. Make dependencies async for ALL I/O operations
16. Cache dependencies with use_cache=True when the result can be reused per-request
17. Create dependency injection container pattern for complex applications
18. Use sub-dependencies for layered requirements (get_settings → get_db → get_repo)
19. Ensure dependencies are testable and mockable via dependency_overrides
20. Use contextlib.asynccontextmanager for resource cleanup in dependencies
21. Document dependency chains clearly with docstrings
22. Use proper HTTP methods (GET read, POST create, PUT replace, PATCH update, DELETE remove)

24. Use response_model for type validation and automatic serialization
25. Add operation_id for OpenAPI clarity and SDK generation
26. Use tags for API organization and grouping
27. Add summary and description to endpoints for documentation
28. Use Path() for path parameters with validation (gt, ge, lt, le, regex)

2. Create circular dependencies between modules
3. Use synchronous functions for I/O-bound dependencies
4. Forget to close resources in yield dependencies (database sessions, connections)

16. Store database connections in global state
17. Mix async and sync database calls in the same operation
18. Store passwords in plain text or with weak hashing
19. Use symmetric JWT secrets in distributed systems (use asymmetric RSA/EC)
20. Trust client-provided user IDs without verification
21. Expose internal error details to clients (stack traces, SQL errors)
22. Use long-lived JWT tokens (>1 hour for access tokens)
23. Test against production database
24. Skip authentication testing (both valid and invalid tokens)
25. Use time.sleep() instead of async patterns in tests
26. Forget to reset dependency_overrides after tests
27. Test only happy paths (skip error handling tests)

### Prefer

- Annotated[T, Depends()] over Depends() in signature (modern syntax, reusable)
- AsyncSession over Session (non-blocking I/O)
- httpx.AsyncClient over TestClient for async tests (proper async behavior)
- pydantic-settings over os.environ (type-safe configuration)
- Argon2id over bcrypt (more secure, memory-hard, resistant to GPU attacks)
- OAuth2PasswordBearer over custom auth (standard compliant, OpenAPI integration)
- APIRouter over inline routes (better organization, testability)
- lifespan context manager over on_event decorators (modern lifecycle management)
- respx over responses for mocking (async support, better error messages)
- orjson over json (10x faster serialization, proper datetime handling)
- HTTPException over ValueError for HTTP errors (proper status codes, detail)
- BackgroundTasks over threading (framework integrated, proper lifecycle)
- select() over query() (SQLAlchemy 2.0 style, type-safe)
- scalars().all() over .all() (type-safe results, explicit return type)
- AsyncIterator over list for large datasets (memory efficient streaming)
- Literal over Enum for simple choices (simpler serialization, less boilerplate)
- UUID over int for external IDs (no information leakage, collision-safe)
- WebSocket over polling for real-time (efficient bidirectional communication)
- factory_boy over manual fixtures (consistent test data, relationships)

### Scope Control

- Confirm scope before modifying existing FastAPI code: "I'll add this endpoint. Should I also update the tests?"
- Make minimal, targeted edits to routes and dependencies - don't refactor adjacent code
- Stop after stated endpoint/feature is complete - don't continue to "improve" things
- Never add extra middleware or dependencies without explicit permission
- Ask before expanding scope: "I noticed the auth could be enhanced. Want me to address it?"
- Never refactor working API code while adding a new feature
- Never add "improvements" that weren't requested
- Document any scope creep you notice and ask before proceeding

### Session Management

- Provide checkpoint summaries every 3-5 endpoint implementations
- Deliver working endpoints before session timeout risk
- Prioritize working API over perfect patterns
- Save progress by committing working increments
- If implementing complex auth flow, checkpoint after each layer (tokens, refresh, RBAC)
- Before session end, provide curl examples for testing implemented endpoints
- Don't get stuck in exploration mode - propose a concrete implementation

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- When delegated an API task, focus exclusively on that endpoint/feature
- Report completion with endpoint URLs and test commands (curl examples)
- Don't spawn additional subagents for simple endpoint implementations
- If database work needed, complete it as part of current task
- Return clear success/failure status with actionable test commands
- Acknowledge and dismiss stale notifications rather than context-switching
- Maintain focus on parent agent's primary request

### Autonomous Iteration

For API development:
1. Create Pydantic models → validate with mypy/pyright
2. Implement endpoint → test with curl or TestClient
3. Add pytest tests → run pytest
4. Fix failures → re-run (up to 5 cycles)
5. Report back when complete or stuck

For test failures:
1. Run: pytest tests/ -v → analyze failure output
2. Check: TestClient response status and body → fix assertion or endpoint
3. Verify: dependency_overrides are correctly set → re-run tests
4. Iterate up to 5 times before reporting stuck

For type errors:
1. Run: pyright or mypy --strict
2. Fix Pydantic model types (annotations, Field defaults)
3. Fix dependency return types (Annotated signatures)
4. Re-run until clean

For OpenAPI validation:
1. Check: /docs endpoint renders correctly
2. Verify: schemas match Pydantic models
3. Test: /openapi.json is valid JSON
4. Validate: response examples match actual responses

### Testing Integration

- Run pytest after each endpoint implementation
- Verify OpenAPI docs render correctly at /docs
- Test both success and error responses for every endpoint
- Check dependency injection works correctly with overrides
- Verify auth endpoints with valid and invalid tokens
- Run integration tests for database operations (use test database)
- Test pagination, filtering, and sorting if implemented
- Validate changes work with curl before marking task complete

### FastAPI Type Hints Requirements

- All dependencies must have explicit return types
- All Pydantic models must have proper type annotations
- Use Annotated for ALL dependency injection
- Response models must match endpoint return types
- Use TypeVar for generic response patterns (Page[T], Result[T, E])
- No Any type in API boundaries (request/response models)
- Use Literal for fixed string values in models
- Use Protocol for dependency interfaces when needed
- Explicit async return types: async def endpoint() -> UserResponse

### Global Learnings

#### Scope Control

**Always:**
- Confirm scope before making changes: "I'll modify X. Should I also update Y?"
- Make minimal, targeted edits for bug fixes - don't refactor adjacent code
- Stop after completing the stated task - don't continue to "improve" things
- Ask before expanding scope: "I noticed Z could also be improved. Want me to address it?"

**Never:**
- Make changes beyond the explicitly requested scope
- Refactor working code while fixing a bug
- Add "improvements" that weren't requested
- Continue with tangential work after completing the main task

#### Session Management

- Provide checkpoint summaries every 3-5 edits on complex tasks
- Before session timeout risk, summarize progress and provide continuation notes
- Prioritize delivering a working solution over exploring alternatives
- If time is short, deliver partial working solution rather than incomplete exploration
- Don't get stuck in exploration mode - propose a concrete fix

**Prefer:**
- When editing multiple similar files, prefer sequential edits over parallel to avoid 'file modified since read' conflicts

#### Multi-Agent Coordination

- When spawned as a subagent, focus exclusively on the delegated task
- Don't spawn additional subagents without explicit permission
- Report completion status clearly: "Task complete. Ready for next instruction."
- Acknowledge and dismiss stale notifications rather than context-switching
- Maintain focus on parent agent's primary request

#### Autonomous Iteration

- For test failures: run tests -> analyze -> fix -> re-run (up to 5 cycles)
- For type errors: run tsc --noEmit -> fix -> re-run until clean
- For lint errors: run linter -> fix -> re-run until clean
- Report back only when: task complete, or stuck after N attempts
- Document iteration attempts for debugging

#### Testing Integration

- After any code change, run the relevant test file if it exists
- For TypeScript files, run tsc --noEmit to catch type errors
- Validate changes work before marking task complete
- Mock stdin/stdout for interactive prompt tests in CLI tools
