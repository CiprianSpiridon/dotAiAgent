7. Implement error boundaries with react-error-boundary package
8. Use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting
9. Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled for form inputs
10. Use forwardRef when components need to expose DOM refs
11. Memoize expensive computations with useMemo (measure first, don't guess)
12. Use useCallback for callbacks passed to memoized children
13. Use refs for DOM access and imperative operations, not for state
14. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect return function
15. Use React.StrictMode in development for catching common mistakes
16. Configure vite.config.ts with proper TypeScript and plugins

31. Configure custom theme in tailwind.config.js extend section
32. Use arbitrary values sparingly: [color:#hex], [width:200px]
33. Implement responsive design with breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
34. Use dark mode with class strategy for user preference
35. Extract repeated utilities with @apply sparingly (prefer components)
36. Configure content paths for tree-shaking unused CSS

30. Skip async waitFor for dynamic content
31. Mock everything (prefer real implementations)
32. Use excessive snapshot testing
33. Use time-based delays in tests (use waitFor)

### Prefer

- Vitest over Jest (10-20x faster, Vite-native)
- Zustand over Redux (simpler API, less boilerplate)
- TanStack Query over SWR (better devtools, mutation support)
- Tailwind 3 + PostCSS over CSS-in-JS (stable, fast builds)
- tinykeys over hotkeys-js (smaller, TypeScript-first)
- react-error-boundary over class ErrorBoundary (hooks support)
- userEvent over fireEvent (realistic user simulation)
- MSW over axios-mock-adapter (network-level mocking)
- Radix UI over Headless UI (better accessibility, more components)
- React Router 7 over wouter (full-featured, data loading)
- @tanstack/react-table over react-table (TypeScript, maintained)
- date-fns over moment (tree-shakeable, immutable)
- clsx over classnames (smaller, faster)
- nanoid over uuid (smaller, URL-safe)
- bun build --compile over electron (no runtime deps, smaller binary)
- bun over node (faster, built-in bundler)
- ky over axios (smaller, native fetch-based)
- Zod over Yup (TypeScript-first, better inference)

### Scope Control

- Confirm scope before modifying React components: "I'll update this component. Should I also update related components?"
- Make minimal, targeted edits to components - don't refactor adjacent code
- Stop after stated feature is complete - don't continue to "improve" things
- Never add extra state, hooks, or dependencies without permission
- Ask before expanding scope: "I noticed the form could use validation. Want me to add it?"
- Document any scope creep you notice and ask before proceeding
- Never refactor working components while adding features

### Session Management

- Provide checkpoint summaries every 3-5 component implementations
- Deliver working UI before session timeout risk
- Prioritize working features over perfect patterns
- Save progress by committing working increments
- If implementing complex features, checkpoint after each milestone
- Before session end, provide test commands and demo instructions
- Don't get stuck in exploration mode - propose concrete solutions

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- When delegated a UI task, focus exclusively on that component/feature
- Report completion with test commands: "Run `pnpm test` to verify"
- Don't spawn additional subagents for simple component work
- Complete styling as part of component work (not separate task)
- Return clear success/failure status with actionable next steps
- Acknowledge and dismiss stale notifications
- Maintain focus on parent agent's primary request

### Autonomous Iteration

For component development:
1. Create component → verify it renders in browser/Vitest
2. Add TypeScript types → run tsc --noEmit
3. Add tests → run vitest run
4. Fix failures → re-run (up to 5 cycles)
5. Report back when complete or stuck

For build failures:
1. Run: pnpm build → analyze error output
2. Fix TypeScript or import issues
3. Re-run until build succeeds

For test failures:
1. Run: vitest run → analyze failure
2. Check: component renders correctly → fix
3. Verify: user interactions work → re-run

For style issues:
1. Run: pnpm lint → fix ESLint errors
2. Run: prettier --check . → format code
3. Verify Tailwind classes are correct

### Testing Integration

- Run Vitest after each component change
- Test user interactions with userEvent (click, type, keyboard)
- Verify accessibility with testing-library queries (getByRole)
- Check keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Run build before committing
- Validate responsive design at different breakpoints
- Test error states and loading states
- Verify form validation behavior

### TypeScript Requirements

- Enable strict: true in tsconfig.json
- Enable noUncheckedIndexedAccess for safe array access
- No any type - use unknown or specific types
- Explicit return types on all exported functions
- Use generics for reusable components and hooks
- Use discriminated unions for complex state
- Proper prop types for all components
- Use satisfies for type checking with inference
- Template literal types for string patterns
- Implement type guards for runtime type narrowing

## Learnings

> Auto-synced from `.claude/learnings/agent-learnings.md`

### Global Learnings

#### Scope Control

**Always:**
- Confirm scope before making changes: "I'll modify X. Should I also update Y?"
- Make minimal, targeted edits for bug fixes - don't refactor adjacent code
- Stop after completing the stated task - don't continue to "improve" things
- Ask before expanding scope: "I noticed Z could also be improved. Want me to address it?"

**Never:**
- Make changes beyond the explicitly requested scope
- Refactor working code while fixing a bug
- Add "improvements" that weren't requested
- Continue with tangential work after completing the main task

#### Session Management

- Provide checkpoint summaries every 3-5 edits on complex tasks
- Before session timeout risk, summarize progress and provide continuation notes
- Prioritize delivering a working solution over exploring alternatives
- If time is short, deliver partial working solution rather than incomplete exploration
- Don't get stuck in exploration mode - propose a concrete fix

**Prefer:**
- When editing multiple similar files, prefer sequential edits over parallel to avoid 'file modified since read' conflicts

#### Multi-Agent Coordination

- When spawned as a subagent, focus exclusively on the delegated task
- Don't spawn additional subagents without explicit permission
- Report completion status clearly: "Task complete. Ready for next instruction."
- Acknowledge and dismiss stale notifications rather than context-switching
- Maintain focus on parent agent's primary request

#### Autonomous Iteration

- For test failures: run tests -> analyze -> fix -> re-run (up to 5 cycles)
- For type errors: run tsc --noEmit -> fix -> re-run until clean
- For lint errors: run linter -> fix -> re-run until clean
- Report back only when: task complete, or stuck after N attempts
- Document iteration attempts for debugging

#### Testing Integration

- After any code change, run the relevant test file if it exists
- For TypeScript files, run tsc --noEmit to catch type errors
- Validate changes work before marking task complete
- Mock stdin/stdout for interactive prompt tests in CLI tools

### Agent-Specific Learnings

- Run tsc --noEmit after edits to catch type errors early
- Prefer explicit types over inference for public APIs
- Use strict mode configuration
