## Rules

### Always

1. Use TodoWrite tool to track tasks and progress for complex or multi-step work (create todos at start, mark in_progress when working, mark completed when done)
2. Use Expo SDK 52+ with New Architecture enabled by default (Fabric, TurboModules, JSI)
3. Use expo-router for all navigation (file-based routing in app/ directory)
4. Create _layout.tsx files for shared navigation structure (tabs, stacks, drawers)
5. Use TypeScript strict mode with expo-router typed routes auto-generation
6. Run npx expo-doctor before builds to check SDK compatibility and configuration
7. Use expo-video for all video playback (stable in SDK 52, replaces deprecated expo-av)
8. Implement ErrorBoundary components for crash recovery and error reporting
9. Use Suspense boundaries for async operations with skeleton UIs
10. Configure metro.config.js properly for module resolution and aliases

45. Implement proper keyboard handling with KeyboardAvoidingView
46. Use SafeAreaView or useSafeAreaInsets() for proper edge insets
47. Implement responsive design with useWindowDimensions() or Dimensions API
48. Use StyleSheet.create() for all styles (performance optimization via style IDs)
49. Write Jest unit tests for business logic, utilities, and stores
50. Use React Native Testing Library for component tests (behavior over implementation)

78. Handle app state changes (background, foreground, inactive) properly
79. Implement deep linking with expo-linking and expo-router integration

### Never

1. Use Redux unless at enterprise scale with 10+ developers (use Zustand instead)
2. Fetch data in useEffect without proper cleanup (use TanStack Query or AbortController)
3. Store sensitive data in AsyncStorage (use expo-secure-store for encryption)
4. Use expo-av for new video implementations (deprecated, use expo-video)
5. Skip error boundaries (crashes will terminate the app without recovery)
6. Use inline styles for repeated components (use StyleSheet.create)
7. Import entire libraries when tree-shaking is possible (import specific functions)
8. Use synchronous storage APIs in render (blocks UI thread)
9. Skip TypeScript strict mode (lose type safety benefits)
10. Hard-code environment values (use expo-constants and app.config.js)
11. Mix expo-router with @react-navigation directly (router is built on it, use router API)
12. Use navigation.navigate() pattern from React Navigation (use router.push())
13. Create navigation structure outside app/ directory
14. Skip _layout.tsx files for route groups (breaks navigation structure)
15. Use index.js files instead of proper _layout.tsx for layouts
16. Ignore typed routes feature (lose compile-time route checking)
17. Put server state in Zustand (use TanStack Query for server state)
18. Create multiple Zustand stores when one with slices suffices
19. Mutate state directly without using set() in Zustand
20. Skip query invalidation after mutations (causes stale data)
21. Use global state for component-local state (overcomplicates simple state)
22. Store derived state (compute from source state instead)
23. Render large lists without FlatList or FlashList (ScrollView renders all items)
24. Create new objects or arrays in render without memoization
25. Use anonymous functions as props without useCallback (causes re-renders)
26. Skip keyExtractor in FlatList (causes incorrect recycling and bugs)
27. Load all images at full resolution (use expo-image with proper sizing)
28. Block the JS thread with heavy synchronous operations
29. Skip testing on both platforms before merging
30. Write tests that depend on implementation details (test behavior instead)
31. Mock everything in tests (some integration is valuable)
32. Skip E2E tests for critical user flows
33. Deploy without testing OTA update rollback capability
34. Skip expo-doctor checks before production builds
35. Use development profile for production deployments
36. Hard-code API keys in source code (use environment variables)
37. Skip proper versioning (users see inconsistent app versions)
38. Deploy breaking changes without feature flags
39. Skip monitoring OTA update adoption rates
40. Use deprecated APIs without migration plan
41. Ignore accessibility requirements (VoiceOver, TalkBack support)
42. Skip proper error handling for native module calls
43. Use synchronous Alert.alert in critical paths (use async patterns)
44. Ignore memory leaks from event listeners and subscriptions

- TanStack Query over custom fetch hooks (caching, refetching, devtools, persistence)
- expo-image over react-native-fast-image (official, maintained, same performance)
- expo-video over react-native-video (official, SDK integrated, better support)
- expo-secure-store over react-native-keychain (simpler API, managed workflow)
- expo-camera over react-native-camera (official, managed workflow, better docs)

- Maestro over Detox for E2E (simpler setup, YAML-based, visual testing)
- React Native Testing Library over Enzyme (modern, maintained, behavior-focused)
- Jest over other test runners (standard, well-documented, RN integration)
- MSW over manual fetch mocking (realistic API mocking, request interception)
- EAS Build over local builds (cloud, faster, managed credentials, consistency)
- EAS Update over CodePush (official, integrated, channels, fingerprint)
- expo fingerprint over manual rebuild detection (smart, accurate, saves time)
- Production channel over direct deploys (staged rollouts, safer releases)
- TypeScript over JavaScript (type safety, better DX, fewer runtime errors)
- Functional components over class components (hooks, simpler, modern patterns)
- Named exports over default exports (better refactoring, explicit imports)
- MMKV over AsyncStorage for performance-critical storage (synchronous, faster)
- expo-linking over Linking from react-native (better integration, typed)

### Scope Control

- Confirm scope before making changes: "I'll modify X. Should I also update Y?"
- Make minimal, targeted edits for bug fixes - don't refactor adjacent components
- Stop after completing the stated task - don't continue to "improve" things
- Ask before expanding scope: "I noticed Z could also be improved. Want me to address it?"
- Never make changes beyond the explicitly requested scope
- Never refactor working code while fixing a bug
- Never add "improvements" that weren't requested

### Session Management

- Provide checkpoint summaries every 3-5 edits on complex tasks
- Before session timeout risk, summarize progress and provide continuation notes
- Prioritize delivering a working solution over exploring alternatives
- If time is short, deliver partial working solution rather than incomplete exploration
- Don't get stuck in exploration mode - propose a concrete fix

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- When spawned as a subagent, focus exclusively on the delegated task
- Don't spawn additional subagents without explicit permission
- Report completion status clearly: "Task complete. Ready for next instruction."
- Acknowledge and dismiss stale notifications rather than context-switching
- Maintain focus on parent agent's primary request

### Autonomous Iteration

- For Metro bundler errors: run npx expo start --clear → analyze → fix → re-run (up to 5 cycles)
- For EAS build failures: run eas build → analyze logs → fix app.config.js/plugins → re-run until success
- For TypeScript errors: run npx tsc --noEmit → fix type errors → re-run until clean
- For expo-doctor issues: run npx expo-doctor → fix SDK mismatches → re-run until all checks pass
- For test failures: run npm test → analyze → fix → re-run (up to 5 cycles)
- Report back only when: task complete, or stuck after N attempts
- Document iteration attempts for debugging

### Testing Integration

- After any component/screen change, run relevant Jest tests
- Run TypeScript check: npx tsc --noEmit to catch type errors early
- Run npx expo-doctor to verify SDK compatibility
- Test on iOS simulator AND Android emulator before marking complete
- Run Maestro E2E tests for critical user flows when they exist
- Mock native modules with jest.mock() when needed
- Validate changes work before marking task complete

### TypeScript Requirements

- Enable strict: true in tsconfig.json
- Enable noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes
- Use path aliases (@ for src imports) via metro.config.js and tsconfig.json
- No any type - use unknown and narrow with type guards
- Use explicit return types for functions and hooks
- Leverage expo-router typed routes (auto-generated from file structure)
- Use interface for object shapes, type for unions and primitives
- Use generics for reusable typed components and hooks
- Use satisfies operator for type checking without widening
- Define typed Zustand stores with explicit state and action types
